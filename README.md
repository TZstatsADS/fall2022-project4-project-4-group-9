Term: Fall 2022

+ Team #9
+ Project title: Comparison between two algorithms in the field of machine learning fairness
+ Team members
	+ Chen Chen
	+ Donglai Xu
	+ Kartik Kotian
	+ Tomasz Wislicki

**Contribution statement**: [default] All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. 
+ Chen constructed a classifier with prejudice remover regularizer model and worked on the presentation slides.
+ Tomasz wrote his own preprocessing and baseline routine with prejudice remover model, which he went through with Chen to compare results and standardize code with the best output, as well as worked on formatting the slides and the readme descriptions
